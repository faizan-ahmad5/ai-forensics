# AI Forensics – AI Image Detector
AI Forensics is a web-based application that allows users to determine whether an image is AI-generated or real. With an easy-to-use interface, it leverages state-of-the-art image classification models to provide highly accurate detection results.

---

## Features

* **Image Upload & Analysis:** Upload images directly from your device for AI detection.
* **URL Analysis:** Analyze images hosted online by pasting their URL.
* **Accurate Detection:** Uses a fine-tuned model trained on 120,000 images (AI-generated + human) with 99.23% accuracy.
* **Confidence Score:** See the probability of an image being AI-generated or real.
* **History:** Keeps track of the last 5 analyzed images.
* **Mobile-First & Responsive:** Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How the System Works

1. **Frontend Upload/URL Input:**
   Users upload an image or provide an image URL via the web interface.

2. **API Request:**
   The frontend sends the image to a backend endpoint (deployed via Vercel AI Functions) using a POST request with `multipart/form-data`.

3. **Model Inference:**
   The backend uses a pre-trained Hugging Face model (`SiglipForImageClassification`) to classify the image.

   * Model was fine-tuned on 60,000 AI-generated and 60,000 human images.
   * Supports detection of images generated by popular AI models like Midjourney, Flux, Stable Diffusion, GPT-4o, etc.

4. **Result Parsing & Display:**

   * The backend returns a JSON response like:

     ```json
     {
       "ok": true,
       "result": [
         { "label": "AI-Generated", "score": 0.9996, "imageSrc": "image-url" }
       ]
     }
     ```
   * Frontend parses the response and displays:

     * Label (`AI-Generated` / `Human-Captured`)
     * Confidence score (%)
     * Digital fingerprint for AI artifacts (if detected)

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Vercel AI Functions (Serverless)
* **Model:** Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch
* **Visualization:** Recharts for digital fingerprint charts

## Future Enhancements

* Support for video analysis.
* Browser extension to detect AI-generated images on social media.
* Enhanced artifact detection and explanation.
* Multi-language support.
